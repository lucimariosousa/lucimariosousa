Hello,
I'm a brazilian physicist and data scientist. I have a bachelor and master degree in physics. Currently i'm working on some data science projects, bellow i detail some of the main projects in the repositories:

- [Credit modelling with machine learning](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Credit-modelling-with-machine-learning): In this project we perform a credit modelling with machine learning, which is a common data science problem in the finance sector. The datasaet consists on informations of a group of individuals who took a loan from a bank. The problem consists in the following: Considering the investor's point of view, we want to avoid people that will default their loan. Create a machine learning model to allow a conservative investor to avoid people that will default on their loans. This project is separated into 3 parts: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Modelling.
- [Credit Risk Classification - Logistic Regression, SVM and Deeplearning](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Credit-Risk-Classification-Logistic-Regression-SVM-and-Deeplearning): In this project we apply the Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms to classify the credit risk of the credit [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset). The problem consists in the classification of the clients as 'high risk' or 'low risk' to take a loan. 
- [Time Series Analysis - Stock Pricec Prediction](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Time-Series-Analysis---Stock-Prices-Prediction): In this project we perform a time series analysis of the brazilian Ibovespa index , spanning a range from 249 trading days. Ir order to look for trends in the prices we apply the moving averege, exponential averege and double exponential averege algorithms. And we apply the Dickey-Fuller test to check if there is any stationary behavior.
- [Credit Risk Classification](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Classification---Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest): In this project we apply the techniques of Decision Trees and Random Forest to classifiy the credit risk of a dataset simulating credit bureau data
