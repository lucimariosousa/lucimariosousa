Hello,
I'm a brazilian physicist and data scientist. I have a bachelor and master degree in physics. Currently i'm working on some machine learning and time series projects. My curriculum can be found [here](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/curriculum). Bellow i detail some of the main projects in the repositories:

- [Credit modelling with machine learning](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Credit-modelling-with-machine-learning): In this project we perform a credit modelling with machine learning, which is a common data science problem in the finance sector. The datasaet consists on informations of a group of individuals who took a loan from a bank. The problem consists in the following: Considering the investor's point of view, we want to avoid people that will default their loan. Create a machine learning model to allow a conservative investor to avoid people that will default on their loans. This project is separated into 3 parts: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Modelling.
- [Credit Risk Classification - Logistic Regression, SVM and Deeplearning](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Credit-Risk-Classification-Logistic-Regression-SVM-and-Deeplearning): In this project we apply the Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms to classify the credit risk of the credit [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset). The problem consists in the classification of the clients as 'high risk' or 'low risk' to take a loan. 
- [Time Series Analysis - Stock Pricec Prediction](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Time-Series-Analysis---Stock-Prices-Prediction): In this project we perform a time series analysis of the brazilian Ibovespa index , spanning a range from 249 trading days. In order to look for trends in the prices we apply the moving averege, exponential averege and double exponential averege algorithms. And we apply the Dickey-Fuller test to check if there is any stationary behavior.
- [Predicting the Rent Price of Brazilian Houses](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Predicting-the-rent-price-of-brazilian-houses): In this project we create a machine learning model to predict the rent price of brazilian houses using this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rubenssjr/brasilian-houses-to-rent?resource=download). We used three different regression models, but they all have the same performance.
- [Exploring Brazil's Exportations over 10 Years](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Exploring-Brazil-s-exportations-over-10-years): (In construction!!) [The Atlas of Economic Complexity](https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/) provides an enormous dataset of product exrportations of tens of countries. In this project we will use the PowerBI to analyze the data related to Brazil's exportantions over the decade 2009-2019 in order to look for trends in the market, which may provide opportunities of investiments in specific sectors of the economy.
- [Credit Risk Classification](https://github.com/lucimariosousa/Classification---Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest): In this project we apply the techniques of Decision Trees and Random Forest to classifiy the credit risk of a dataset simulating credit bureau data
